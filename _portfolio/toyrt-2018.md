* A physically-based renderer written in C++.
* Has the following features:
    * custom scene format design and definition using JSON,
    * ray-sphere intersection,
    * area emitters,
    * lambertian diffuse and Blinn-Phong materials with cosine-weighted hemisphere sampling of the BRDF,
    * path tracing integrator using MIS with BSDF and Emitter sampling, and
    * modular path sampling interface extendable to arbitrary sampling techniques
